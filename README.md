# Sidebar react component

Inspired from [this blog][1].

Use the following command to create the project:
```
npm init vite recursive-menu --template react
```
When prompted, select *react* as project template.

Note that differently from the blog description:
- no icons have been used
- use *Routes* instead of *Switch*
- use *useMatch* instead of *useRouteMatch*
